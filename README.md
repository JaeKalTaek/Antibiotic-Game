## History

We worked on this game as a team of 5 during the CRI Labs Summer School of 2017. This project was proposed to us by 3 medical students. They were working on this game for a few years already, and asked us advice to improve their game. During the few weeks working on this project, we changed mechanics and features to try and make the game more appealing and fun, encountering obstacles and hiccups along our way that we will list here. 

One of the biggest hurdle we had was the constraint of making a serious game, so aimed at teaching knowledge to its players. The goal of bacteria battle is to help medical students learn the associations between a particular infection with all its parameters, and the associated antibiotic to use in each case. So we had to keep the balance between too much information and too little. Too much would make the game a simple simulation of real life, with no real fun from game rules. Too little would lack important information for the students to learn, or worse, teach them wrong information. All the while keeping the game fun enough to be enjoyable. 
The process for this was a constant back and forth between us and our mentors. One of the party would imagine a game feature, submit it to the mentors to know if it was scientifically accurate, and then we would decide to integrate it into the game or not. 

Another hurdle, arising from the solution of the one before, was an increasing number of features into the game. It was far too complex, and it ended up slowing the game down and made the game too heavy to learn for new players. Too much information would be displayed constantly from the cards, the board and the play area to really keep track of what was happening. 
We ended up solving this problem by sitting down and playing the game with a mentor, cutting out features one by one until the game flowed perfectly. We then decided to not add any features to this and focused on polishing the existing ones. 

At the end of the project, we were happy with the result. Working on this project taught us how to work in a team composed with people from really different backgrounds. For example, game designers had to explain most of the choices made. It could seem like a waste of time, but it forced the team to talk together about the game and unify the minds on what the game was like.
